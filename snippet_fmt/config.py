	The languages to reformat. The keys correspond to the value after ``.. code-block::``, including matching case.


	The values are ``key: value`` mappings giving language-specific options.
	The exact options vary, but each has a ``reformat`` option which defaults to :py:obj:`False`.
	If set to :py:obj:`True` the code snippets in that language will be reformatted,
	otherwise they will only be syntax checked.

	For example, the following code block has a value of ``'TOML'``:

	.. code-block:: rst

		.. code-block:: TOML

			key = "value"

	Different capitalisation (e.g. ``JSON`` vs ``json``) can be used to apply different settings to
	different groups of code blocks. For example, ``JSON`` code blocks could have and indent of 2,
	but ``json`` blocks have no indentation.
